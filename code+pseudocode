#On this collaborate document it is going to be developped the corresponding programming commands to create the
#perfect trip for the cutomer, who is traveling from one city to their desired destination, 
# by train or plane and finally staying on a hotel.
# Through the algorithm, the cutomer is going to be asked the budget they are willing to spend, the quality of the transportation: 
# high class(related to higher prices) and, finally, the quality of the accomodation, again, 
# being high class related to higer prices.


#To start with, our dataset was found and downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/ as an excel file, to finally be imported from excel to python language. 
#Altough the dataset, being an excel file, has a high amount of useful data, it will need to be cleaned and added some columns, such as Hotels or Hotel prices.
#As a result, we concluded that pandas package will be the the best option for cleaning, structing, analysis and visualization of the data as it related the 
#excel data with our programming language. 

#So, in the next chunk, pandas package will be installed.

#In order to work with the dataset, we will start by reading it with pandas.

#The dataset does not have prices for the hotel. Our programming knowledge could help us
#by creating random numbers in a range of prices we stablish, taking into account the normal prices
#in the market, we stablish a price range of 50 to 400.

#For achiving creating random number, we use a for loop in which for every observation,
#a random unique number is added by the command .sample in the new list called: hotel_prices. 
#Same for the ticket_prices

#Then, we create a new variable called "Hotel price" with the values form the variable hotel_prices. 
#Same for ticket price

df['Hotel price'] = hotel_prices[0]
df['Ticket price'] = ticket_prices[0]

#To continue with, we aim to offer our customers, among other things, the name of the plane or train company. 
#As our initial dataset does not have this variable, we create a new one, again, by a for loop and randomly.

#To follow up with, we decided to randomly asign to each trip, if it is going to be made by
#train or plane. This is a benefit because the dataset was previously assigned the same transportation method
#for the same route(ex: plane for Berlin-Warsaw). This idea is executed by filtering the plane and train by 
#applying the mask method, followed by a for loop inside a function that randomly assings wheter be travelling by each of the
#modes. Finally, separated dataframes are created, calling the list_choice function, to finally be joined by .concat() function.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#The last step of cleaning the dataset is creating different variables for departure and destination, as our initial 
#dataset had it all in one. For this we create empty lists: destinations and departures, which will be filled by 
#for loops which will append in the case of departures the first word from the variable routes, and in the case 
#of destinations, the second word. For appending the .append() function is used, and for obtaining the 
#first or second word, .split() will be used.

#In order to obtain the same result each time the algorith is run, we use .seed(x). 
#To continue with, there are some variables such as mode (because we created new variables) or ecopassengerc02 (not useful anymore)
# that will be eliminated from the dataset by the command .drop(). Also, again, we will recall the list_choice function for the destinations
#to be randomly assigned. This will avoid that a departure just has one destination, which was a limitation from our initial dataset.

#All this must be ordered into the final dataset to be easier to read. This is why we use .iloc

#Our app aims to obtain the best trip according to the customers´s budget, departure and type of transportation. In order to do this,
#we concluded that the easiest way would be to create a quicksort algorithm, where a random number will be taken as a pivot by the 
#command rd.choice(). Then, the quicksort will place the pivot in the correct position in a sorted array.
# This will be done by a for loop inside an if conditional, in which if the array has less than 2 numbers, 
# the array will be returned, else, as we said a for loop will ccheck again through if conditionals,
#whether the numbers in the array are bigger or smaller than the pivot, returning a sorted list.

#We aim to work several times with our customers, so we will assign each customer an account in order to provide them 
#a more personal trait. The code for creating an account consist of inputs that ask the user whether if the have already an account
